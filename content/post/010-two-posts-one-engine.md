What does a good nerd do when feeling the urge to write on a topic ?
Why, update his blogging tool, of course. I've actually loved static
site generators since the days where I had one based on make and m4, I
also want a lot of simplicity from the tool I use to blog.

I started out with posterous because I didn't want to bother with
hosting details from a blog, being a technology ascetic, I also often
want it to match my current tools of choice. I also cannot go to extreme
length on my own since I'm a design noob.

Anyhow, that's why I've gradually changed from:

-   [posterous](http://posterous.com) (I felt the need to host on my
    own)
-   [octopress](http://octopress.org) (I don't use ruby much anymore)
-   [o-blog](http://renard.github.com/o-blog)

Since I started using emacs a lot again, I switched to org-mode for my
GTD like workflow and o-blog seemed like a good fit. With great tools
like [twitter bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap) to help
the design impaired like me, it's now very easy to get a decent looking
site up and running from a simple emacs org file.
