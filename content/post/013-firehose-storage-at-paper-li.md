I was very happy to give a talk on the experience we had with cassandra
over at paper.li for the first Paris-Cassandra meetup (if you're
interested, go follow [@pariscassa](https://twitter.com/pariscassa)).

While not diving too deep, I tried to give a battlefield overview of how
we came to the decision to go for cassandra, what we do with it and a
few tips should you choose it, very much in the same vein than my
previous post on clojure[^1]

Here are the slides for the talk:

</script>
Since no-one didn't speak french during the meetup, the talk was given
in french, recorded and streamed thanks to google plus hangouts (which
is quite impressive I have to say). If you grok french, the video can be
found here: <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uwt-KF7eVOY#t=32m06>
