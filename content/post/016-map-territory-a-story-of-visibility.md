Many thanks to the \#devops crew for hosting devops days Paris ! I loved
the diversity of the talks, the ignite format is really interesting.

What struck me most is how devops is now reaching its intended audience,
i.e: everyone involved in delivering quality software and services. It
was really nice to see people from all types of companies and all types
of positions.

Here are the slides for the talk I gave:
